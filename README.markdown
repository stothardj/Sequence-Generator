# Sequence Genrator

This is another program for me to practice with Haskell. This time I implemented an old CS 31 specification I found online. The complete specification can be found [here](http://www.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter05/cs31/hw/p3/spec.html). It was originally intended to be implemented in C++.

## Running and Installation

You can use the haskell interpreter to run this program with

    runhaskell Main.hs

If you really want to install this for some reason, standard installation as a user into $HOME/bin:

    runhaskell Setup configure --prefix=$HOME --user
    runhaskell Setup build
    runhaskell Setup install


## Reporting bugs

This is my second program ever written in Haskell and done to learn the syntax. Any suggestions are welcome at stothardj@gmail.com
